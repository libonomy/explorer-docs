## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check [the list of open issues](https://github.com) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please [submit a new issue](https://github.com).

Here are a few tips for writing _great_ bug reports:

-   Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
-   Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
-   Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
-   Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
-   Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
-   Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

**If you find a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. Please email security@github.com instead.**
